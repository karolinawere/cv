                        <h1>Karolina Weremkowicz</h1>
                        <p class="candidate-description"> In August, I got an internship as a Scrum Master. I was a member of one team. My job was to familiarize and introduce scrum there. The team consisted of 15 people, so 
                            it was quite a large scrum team. This resulted in the fact that there were all kinds of personalities there that you had to learn to work with. A very useful and amazing 
                            experience for which I am very grateful. After a month, the company offered me a full-time job. Since then I had been working with three teams. One of them consisted of
                            several people after the internship, who were also offered further cooperation. The other two teams were formed before I joined them. The members of one of them had little 
                            to do with scrum while the other consisted of more experienced developers who more or less used scrum. So my job was to straighten out the perception of scrum and work in 
                            this work framework. So there were three different teams, different problems in them, and I had a chance to gain a lot of experience through this. In May, the applications 
                            were completed and so was my career in them. On the same day I was assigned to another project. Since then I have been in a team of eight people. We are working on a tool for
                            employees to mark their hours at work. In addition to that, the app is also useful for accountants to work with salary amounts.</p>
