                        <h1>Karolina Weremkowicz</h1>
                        <p class="candidate-description">In August, I started an internship as a Scrum Master, working with a team of 15 people. 
                            My role involved introducing Scrum practices and adapting to the various personalities within the team. After a month, 
                            I was offered a full-time position and began working with three teams. One team comprised individuals who had also 
                            completed the internship, while the other two teams were already established but had different levels of experience 
                            with Scrum. My responsibility was to align their understanding of Scrum and work within this framework. This experience 
                            allowed me to gain valuable insights while tackling different team challenges. In May, the projects concluded, and I 
                            transitioned to a new team of eight members. We are currently developing a tool for employee time tracking, which is
                            also beneficial for accountants managing salary amounts.</p>
                      <p class="candidate-description">
                        I am constantly on the lookout for opportunities to gain more experience and become a better Scrum Master. I definitely 
                            enjoy this accountability. I am also taking English lessons to further improve this language. My interest is also 
                            to gain knowledge in HTML, CSS and in the future I would like to learn JavaScript as well. I am not considering 
                            myself as a future programmer, however, I think it is useful in the work of a Scrum Master to learn about the work 
                            of other team members. Seeing communication skills as some of the most important I pay a lot of attention to them and constantly 
                          try to improve in this area. </p>
